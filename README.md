# Plato-NLP
In this project (completed for DS5001 at UVA), I apply various NLP techniques with an aim of resolving the following textual problems in Plato's corpus: 
1.) What, apart from time, distinguishes Plato’s early, middle and late works?, 
2.)Does Plato’s works converge on a set of themes, and if so, what are they? and 3.) 
Can we account on why the Theaetetus, Statesmen and Sophists were published in the
same dramatic universe, even though each work was published at different stages of Plato’s life?
